# Filter_Matlab_and_C

To use the filter:
 
 1. Run the first part of the code in MATLAB (%%Filter in MATLAB")
 
 2. MATLAB will give you a #FILTER_ORDER and in case it is different than 3, you should modify the value in the program in C
 
 3. MATLAB will give you two figures, one with the graph of "freqz" and the second one with the following
        ---> Signal without noise
        ---> Signal with noise
        ---> Signal filtered in Matlab
 
 4. Run your filter in C, it should creat a new file called "OUTPUT.csv"
 
 5. Once the new file is created, run the second part of the program in Matlab (%%Filter in C") and it should give you one more graph.
        ---> Signal with filter in C
